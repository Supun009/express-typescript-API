```

## `src` Directory

- **`config`**: Contains configuration files for external services, such as the database connection.
- **`constants`**: Holds project-wide constants, such as environment variables, HTTP status codes, and user roles.
- **`controllers`**: These are the Express route handlers. They are responsible for handling incoming requests, calling the appropriate services, and sending back the response.
- **`dtos`**: Data Transfer Objects. These are used to define the shape of the data that is sent in the request body and to validate it using Zod.
- **`middlewares`**: Custom Express middlewares, such as authentication, error handling, and logging.
- **`routes`**: Defines the Express routes and maps them to the corresponding controllers.
- **`services`**: Contains the business logic of the application. The services are called by the controllers and are responsible for interacting with the database and other external services.
- **`types`**: Contains custom TypeScript type definitions.
- **`utils`**: Contains utility functions that are used throughout the application.

## `prisma` Directory

- **`schema.prisma`**: The Prisma schema file, which defines the database models and their relations.
- **`migrations`**: Contains the database migration files that are generated by Prisma.

## `tests` Directory

- Contains all the test files for the application. The tests are written using Jest and Supertest.
