# TypeScript Express API Boilerplate

This is a robust and scalable REST API boilerplate built with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. It includes features like user authentication, role-based access control, and user management, making it a great starting point for your next backend project.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Access & Refresh Tokens**: Implements a secure token-based authentication flow with access and refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- **Password Management**: Secure password hashing using bcrypt, with endpoints for changing and resetting passwords.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Middleware to protect routes based on user roles (e.g., `ADMIN` vs. `USER`).
- **User Management**:
  - Users can view and update their own profiles.
  - Admins can perform CRUD operations on all users.
- **Validation**: Strong, type-safe request validation using Zod.
- **Structured & Scalable**: Organized project structure with controllers, services, DTOs, and utility functions.
- **Async Error Handling**: A custom `asyncHandler` utility to gracefully handle errors in asynchronous route handlers.
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support for type safety and improved developer experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running PostgreSQL database instance

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd typeScript-express-example
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run database migrations:**
    Make sure your PostgreSQL database server is running and the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file is correct. Then, run the following command to apply the database schema:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
    This will create the necessary tables in your database based on the schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and fill in your specific configuration details, such as your database connection string and secret keys.

### Running the Application

1.  **Compile TypeScript:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Run in development mode (with hot-reloading):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Run jest testing:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the `PORT` you specified).

## üìù API Endpoints

Here are the main API routes available:

### Auth Routes (`/api/v1/auth`)

- `POST /logout`: Log out the current user.
- `POST /refresh-token`: Refresh an expired access token.
- `POST /forgot-password`: Request a password reset email.
- `POST /reset-password`: Reset password with a valid token.

### User Routes (`/api/v1/users`)
